                <p>Sometimes the best experiences in traveling are the unexpected finds. And so it is with Bohol, that
                    island province that is nestled in the heart of Central Visayas and is aptly called <i><strong>
                     "God's Little Paradise"</strong></i> by those who are caught off-guard by its mystery and
                    charm. Located southeast of Cebu and southwest of Leyte, Bohol is comprised of 47 towns and its capital,
                    Tagbilaran City. Oval in shape like the proverbial ubing kinampay or purple yam, its total land
                    area is 411,726 hectares including 73 other islands and islets.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The name Bohol is thought to be derived from the name of the barrio of Bo-ol, a barangay found in
                    Tagbilaran City which was among the first places toured by the Magellan expedition. History has it
                    that one of the Spanish ships of Magellan (the Concepcion) was burned in this province after
                    Magellan was killed by Lapulapu in Mactan. In 1565 Miguel Lopez de Legazpi anchored in Jagna, one
                    of the eastern municipalities of Bohol. He made a blood compact with the Chiefs Sikatuna and Sigala
                    in a small village near the present capital of the province, Tagbilaran City, signifying they were
                    blood brothers. The province became a Jesuit mission in 1595. At this time, Bohol was a part of the
                    province of Cebu and was called a residencia. It became a separate politico-military province on
                    July 22, 1854, together with the island of province of Siquijor. In 1879, there were 34 towns
                    belonging to the province with a total population of 253,103. Bohol has a rich historical and cultural heritage. 
                    History tells us that the first international peace treaty, otherwise known as the "Blood Compact" between Sikatuna 
                    and Legazpi, was made on the island.
